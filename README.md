Reversi engine

This is a simple reversi engine that uses the allegro library for graphics but also supports text terminal output.
The engine merely iterates along the complete search tree for a specified depth ("difficulty") and finds the best
move by trying to maximize its share of the stones. Can play as either black or white.

This is a bare-bones program that could use a few more bells and whistles on the graphical and audio sides. I'm not a 
particularly good reversi player myself, but the engine seems strong enough for interesting games. The source code is
hopefully adequately documented if anyone is interested in extending it.
